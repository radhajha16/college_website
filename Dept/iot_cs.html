        <div id="about">
            <p>
                The department of Computer Science and Engineering (IoT & Cyber Security including Blockchain Technology) was established in AY 2020-21. The department started with an intake of 60 students in UG program. The department has highly qualified, experienced and dedicated teaching and supporting staffs. The department has fully equipped laboratories with modern and sophisticated equipment.

                Billions of interconnected smart devices measuring, moving, and acting upon all the bits of data that makes up daily life, so IoT represents a tremendous opportunity for various types of companies, including IoT application and service providers, IoT platform providers and integrators, telecom operators, and software vendors. These IOT enabled devices and computer systems plays an important role in our day to day lives. We rely on these systems for purposes such as entertainment, banking, education, governance, shopping, healthcare, business, research etc.
                
                Cyber Security deals with the security of computer systems from the theft of computer hardware, software, data and disruption or misdirection of the services provided by computer systems. Cyber Security also imparts knowledge about the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. The curriculum of this programme is designed in such a way along with IoT and Cyber Security that students are also exposed to the Basic Cryptographic primitives used in Blockchain, basic Distributed System concepts, Basic Blockchain concepts, and working knowledge of the emerging Blockchain technology. During the tenure of this programme, students develop an understanding of the emerging abstract models for Blockchain Technology.
