        <div id="about">
            <p>
                The department of Mechanical Engineering was established in 1994, having illustrious history and offers
                Bachelor of Engineering, Master of Engineering and Doctoral degree programme. The department is vibrant
                with several activities round the year. We have research focus that benefits industry, society and the
                environment. The department is fortified with highly motivated faculty members, who besides their
                regular activities of teaching, do research and interact with industries. Faculties are actively
                involved in different sponsored projects funded by University of Mumbai, ICMR, SERB and most of our
                projects are sponsored or implemented in various industries.

                The Department is well equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and infrastructural facilities in
                thrust areas. It has advanced laboratories of Manufacturing, Thermal Engineering, Fluids Engineering,
                Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, latest tools in the work shop, welding shop and carpentry. It also
                has seven advanced computing centres with software in Finite Element Analysis and Modeling, Automation
                etc.

                The department is headed by Dr. Chandrababu Divakaran with thirty years teaching experience. His area of
                interest includes Supply chain Management, Knowledge Management, Renewable Energy Sources. Mechanical
                Engineering Student Association (MESA) was formed to accelerate academic activities of students and
                faculty. The MESA organises technical activities like seminars, student competitions and Industrial
                visits at regular intervals for the benefit of the students. Also, the department takes pride in
                achievements of its alumni, who have established themselves in various walks of life.
